# typescript
This a learning repository for me to learn the syntax, features and do's and dont's of typescript

## My disclaimer
Be warned this is only a learning project. All code residing in this project and or repo is my attempt to learn typescript and react.  
So it is possible that some code maybe not best practice or standard. 

## Somewhat of clean code
If you want to look of some code where i have learned a little bit of convention and or best practice than look here:
 - /maps
